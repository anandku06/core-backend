## Why index.js name?

- bcz in a folder, when a proper name is given, then no need of giving the file's name to be same again
- node detects the index.js file as the main or root file for execution
- to execute the file , we use : `node fileName.js`

## Node Module System

- allows to organise your code into multiple reusable pieces of code
- a large codebase divided into multiple small codebases that are organised in a root file and then run to get the desired result
